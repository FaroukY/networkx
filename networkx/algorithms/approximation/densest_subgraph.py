    For a subset of the vertices of $G$, $S \subseteq V(G)$, define 
    $E(S) = \{ (u,v) : (u,v)\in E(G), u\in S, v\in S \}$ as the set of
    edges with both endpoints in $S$. The density of $S$ is defined as 
    $E(S)/|S|$, the ratio between the edges in the subgraph $G[S]$ and 
    the number of nodes in that subgraph. The densest subgraph problem
    asks to find the subgraph $S \subseteq V(G)$ with maximum density. 

    The densest subgraph problem is polynomial time solvable using 
    maximum flow, commonly refered to as Goldberg's algorithm. 
    However, the algorithm is quite involved. It first
    binary searches on the optimal density, $d^\ast$. For a guess of 
    the density $d$, it sets up a flow netowkr $G'$ with size O(m). The 
    maximum flow solution either informs the algorithm that no subgraph
    with density $d$, or it returns (implicitly) a subgraph with density
    $d$. However, this is inherently bottlenecked by the maximum flow. 
    For example, authors from [2]_ noted that the Goldbergâ€™s algorithm 
    failed on many large graphs even though they used a highly optimized 
    maximum flow library.

    Due to the importance of the proble and solving it on large scale graphs,
    there are several known approximation algorithms for the problem. 

    Charikar [1]_ described a very simple 1/2-approximation algorithm for DSG known as 
    the greedy "peeling" algorithm. The algorithm creates an ordering of the vertices as follows. 
    The first vertex $v_1$ is the one with the smallest degree in G (ties broken arbitrarily). 
    It selects $v_2$ to be the smallest degree vertex in $G \setminus v_1$. Letting $G_i$ be the
    graph after removing $v_1, ..., v_i$ (with $G_0=G$), the algorithm returns the graph among 
    $G_0, ..., G_n$ with the highest density. 

    Boob et al. [2]_ generalized this algorithm into Greedy++, an iterative algorithm that runs 
    several rounds of "peeling". The algorithm converges to a $(1-\epsilon)$ approximate densest
    subgraph in $O(\Delta(G)\log n/\epsilon^2)$ iterations (amongst other properties), as shown by 
    [4]_ and [5]_. 

    Harb et al. [3]_ gave a faster and more scalable algorithm using ideas from quadratic programming
    for the densest subgraph, which is based on FISTA algorithm.
